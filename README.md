# Huffman-File-Compressor
This project implements Huffman coding, a popular algorithm for data compression, in C++. Huffman coding efficiently compresses data by assigning shorter codes to more frequent characters and longer codes to less frequent characters. The program reads input from a file, calculates character frequencies, constructs a Huffman tree, and encodes the input text using the generated Huffman codes. It also provides functionality to decode the encoded data back to its original form.

Features:
Compression: Reduces the size of input text by assigning variable-length codes based on character frequencies.
Decompression: Restores the original text from encoded binary data using the Huffman tree.
File I/O: Reads input from a text file, writes compressed data to an encoded file, and decodes data from an encoded file back to its original format.
Statistics: Calculates compression ratio and percentage to measure the effectiveness of compression.
How To Use:-
Compile the Program using a C++ compiler ,which reads input from input.txt and compress it and writes the encoded dat to encoded.txt ,the code also decodes the encoded file and outputs the decoded text to decoded.txt. Sample files are attached as well.
